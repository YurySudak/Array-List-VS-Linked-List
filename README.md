This project is show performance in such operations as Remove+Add and Get in Java Array List and Linked List.

This program has GUI. You can choose size of list, and method to test.

In table are given results in nanoseconds, how much time was spended on each operation.

Blue color show position of element in list, where operation is performed. 0 - first element, 0.5 - middle element, 1-last element.

Green color for winner, and red color for looser.

Pay attention that results are not the same every time. It depends on what tasks your operation system performs at current time.
And real difference become observable when you set size >= 1 000 000.
